# Models of disease diversity in salmonid farms in Ireland
In this paper and accompnying code, the number of diseases a farm experiences during a year is modeled as a function of the farm's biosecurity score, indegree, and the interaction between these two variables.
A main result is that biosecurity is maximized when the number of providers is low (no more than 1 provider)
